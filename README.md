# MYSTRAN_Benchmark
Benchmarks for MYSTRAN

The MYSTRAN_Benchmark repository is intended to:
 - Compare results between versions of MYSTRAN
   - This is accomplished by comparing all numerical data points from a set of accepted results files (assumed to be correct) from over 100 models, to those of a new build.
   - Intended to find/avoid regressions (bugs) in the software. For example, something worked in 10.0 but not in 10.1.
   - Primarly intended for developers, but end users may also perform an independent verification.
